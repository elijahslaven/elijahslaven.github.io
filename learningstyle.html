<p>
    A visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures.<br>
    You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head,<br>
    and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.<br>
    I Believe that this is true, i more understand the way that i should learn after this.
