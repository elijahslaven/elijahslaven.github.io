<h2>House cat protector</h2>

<p>This House cat protector is used to keep cats that want to pick a fight with your cat away from your house, it uses a sensor to identify when a bad cat goes past the line, and then makes a sound that cats hate to scare it off. but it lets your cat pass without hearing the sound because of the collar that it would be wearing, the collar has a RFID (radio-frequency identification) chip in it. Having this collar it can pass through the field without making the sounds, so it can go home without a scare.</p>

<p>This would be used by pet owners who have evil cats in the area that keep beating up their cat and they would like to keep it safer.</p>

<p>To make this you would need a loudspeaker, bluetooth, waterproofing material to be the case for it, and it would need software, C would be the best choice for software, it can keep it small.</p>

<h4>There are some challenges that would need to be overcome:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Having it smaller so people can carry it</li>
    <li>Having the collar part small enough not to annoy the cat</li>
    <li>Having the computer parts smaller</li>
    <li>Keep cost down</li>
    <li>Weatherproofing for the sensor and collar</li>
    <li>Identifying the correct sound to keep cats away</li>
    <li>Having a Low battery sensor for the cat collar</li>
    <li>Manufacturing it </li>
    <li>Learning C</li>
    <li>Being able to identify what is a cat and what isnâ€™t</li>
    <li>Having the noise not annoying to other people</li>
</ul>
